Charts with d3.js
Responsive D3js Charts shows how to take a static line chart and make it responsive when the browser size changes.

Resize to Scale with d3.js gives code for a render function that adjusts the size of the viewing window based on the parent element for the visualization.

Responsive Data Visualization provides another approach for making responsive D3.js charts.

Make great-looking d3.js charts in Python without coding a line of JavaScript combines a Python backend with the python-nvd3 library to generate d3.js charts without having to hand-write the JavaScript code. If you are interested in a solution like this for your own visualizations then you should also check out Bokeh.

How to make a modern dashboard with NVD3.js uses the NVD3.js library that works as an abstraction on top of d3.js to create charts. The post puts together several charts to show how to build a dashboard based on public JSON data.

D3 ecosystem
The trouble with D3 is not a tutorial but it's an important read because it discusses why D3 can be very difficult to learn: the learning curve depends on your background. If you are a front-end developer you will likely have the easiest time if you already understand JavaScript, SVG and the browser Document Object Model (DOM). Non-technical designers and analysts typically have the hardest time with using D3 because the not only have to learn the tool itself but all the concepts and web browser technologies that it is built upon.

D3.js in Action, Second Edition is partially an announcement for the authors book but also contains good context for who uses D3 and why its usage continues to grow.
